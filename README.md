FiveM Custom QBCORE mining script by me from scratch

Highly customisable via config.lua

Locations are easily changeable/removable
Features several ways to get materials

Gold Panning - Search specified streams for gold and silver, or trash
Mining - Mine to get stones that can be wash or cracked for materials
Stone Washing - Wash stone to find rare gems or gold
Stone Cracking - Crack open stones to find ores for crafting materials
Customisable points for mining, stone cracking and gold panning

Add a Location for an ore to the config and it will use this location for both qb-target and a prop
Can place them anywhere, doesn't have to be just one mining location
I opted for a drilling animation as opposed to the pickaxe swinging
Nicely animated for better immersion
NPC's spawn on the blip locations

These locations can also give third eye and select ones have context menus for selling points
NPC's and ore's Spawn at Mineshaft + Quarry so your players can go to either

Features simplistic built in crafting that uses recipes in the config.lua

Features Jewel Cutting bench as an attempt to add more than just gold bars and such to sell

You can use your gold bars and jewels to craft other items to sell to a Jewellery Buyer
